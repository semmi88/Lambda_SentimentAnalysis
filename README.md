# Lambda_SentimentAnalysis

Project developed as part of a Amazon's Hackathon in 2018.

Main idea is to help customers decide between similar products on Amazon, using sentiment analysis of product reviews and summarizing the results. We can extract some key metrics and potentiatlly warn about negative sentiment in the reviews.

This small script gets review text for Amazon products and compare review sentiment using AWS Comprehend NLP service.
